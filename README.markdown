# Tag Manager

Provides a convenient interface for bulk editing tag list fields. This extension only works with tag list fields that are populated from existing values, as opposed to fields that are populated from other sections.

With Tag Manager, you can:
- Edit the value of a tag and have this change reflected across every entry in the section with that tag.
- Delete any tag from all entries in a section.
- Merge two or more tags.

**This extension is currently experimental.**

## TODOs

- Test, test, test
